DevOps Kickstarter
====================
To get rockin':

```bash
curl -sS https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kenaniah/virtual-devops/master/perform-setup.sh | bash
```

Please note that the scripts will have to use `sudo` in order to set up the puppet dashboard. Sudo requires a tty to be pressent. If you are using ssh, a tty may be faked via `ssh -t`.
